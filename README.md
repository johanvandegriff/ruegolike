# Inspiration
This game is inspired by NetHack, one of the most popular roguelikes and my personal favorite. A roguelike is a category of game that is like the original "rogue" game from 1980. If you take the word "rogue" and swap it around, you get "ruego," which ends with "go," the programming language I used to write this game. Also, in Spanish ruego means a prayer, plea, or request. A Re-QUEST, hmm... Aha! This game is about your character's second, less glamorous quest after completing their main grand objective.
